This repository contains my notes on learning C++11 as well as
reviewing a number of topics in the core language that differ the most
from other programming languages.


If you learned C++ a long time ago and want to get back up to speed
again, or have simply been working in the land of dynamic languages
for the last few years and want to get back to basics, this repository
might be useful to help jog your memory.


 --> You can find my notes in the file titled "[[learning_cpp.org][learning_cpp.org"]]. <--


The various topic directories contain simple source files that
demonstrate valid syntax for various features in isolation.  If they
need any special compiler flags, they will be noted in a comment in
the source file.


Please keep in mind a few things in mind:

 - This repository is *not* an in-depth language tutorial.

 - This repository is *not* intended to be an example of my abilities
   as a programmer.
